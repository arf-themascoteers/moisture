Introducing paper: Felix M. Riese and Sina Keller, “Introducing a Framework of Self-Organizing Maps for Regression of Soil Moisture with Hyperspectral Data,” in 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), Valencia, Spain, 2018, accepted.

The following sensors were deployed:

- Cubert UHD 285 hyperspectral snapshot camera recording 50 by 50 images with 125 spectral bands ranging from 450 nm to 950 nm and a spectral resolution of 4 nm.
 
- TRIME-PICO time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensor in a depth of 2 cm measuring the soil moisture in percent
